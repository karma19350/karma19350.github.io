<div id="main">
  <h1>Page not found</h1>

  <p>It looks like this was the result of either:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A mistyped URL, or a copy-and-paste mistakex</li>
    <li>A broken link on a web pages or in an email</li>
    <li>Moved or deleted content</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Try to solve the problem :)</p>
</div>
