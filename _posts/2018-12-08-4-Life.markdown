# Symphony Orchestra

---



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started practicing musical instruments when I was 4 years old and have been learning music for more than 15 years. I obtained my Portatone Keyboard Amateur Grade 10  In 2008 and Clarinet Amateur Grade 10 In 2012, both of the highest amateur level in China. Since I was admitted into Tsinghua University, I have been the Clarinet of Tsinghua University Symphony Orchestra. During my freshman year,  I participated in 7 performances and won Gold Prize of Group Instrumental Performance in Beijing University Music Festival on behalf of my school, which I am really proud of .

#  Dancing

---



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I entered university, dancing has become one of my hobbies. I am willing to try different kinds of dance! I learned ballet in my figure training class and performed jazz with other girls in Student Festival. Besides, I also do aerobics well and was once an aerobics team member of my department.

# Voluntary Work

---



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoyed doing voluntary work in my spare time. The feeling of helping others is so good. During the summer or winter vacation, I usually go to remote area to do voluntary work . The photos were shot in Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province in 2017, while I was doing voluntary teaching there. You can see tears in both my eyes and my students' eyes since we are so closed and it is so hard to say goodbye.
